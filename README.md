Conclusions

Looking at the 5 components we compared to the variation in home prices, population and education are the most closely correlated components. Also looking at all the values it appears that others have some relation, but there is no single component that tells the whole story. Home prices are influenced by many factors.

In working with this data we all felt that we were only scratching the surface. If we had more time and resources we would like to dig deeper on this question. Given the opportunity we would use finer detail in our locations, possibly looking within one county and comparing prices between neighborhoods or blocks. We would also research the components we used to understand the data better. For example what does income mean, is retirement income included or how would an expensive vacation home influence our results when household income is recorded in another location. 

It is said that the three most important factors in the price of a home are Location, Location, and Location. I'm not so sure.
